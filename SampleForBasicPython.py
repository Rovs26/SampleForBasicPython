#Hello! Welcome to Intro Course in Python

#Today we are going to learn assigning values in variables, do basic operations 
# and learn how you can use Python in solving mathematical problems

#Learning How to assign Values in Variables

#If we want to assign a value to a variable, we first put the variable then an equal sign "=" then the corresponding value
#An example would be "x = 3", now try doing it by yourself

x = 3

#Then we print the variable "x" to see the value of "x"

print(x)

#Now learning that you can assign integer values, you can also assign variables as values to an another variable
#Here's an example "six = x * 2" (The * symbol represents multiplication)

six = x * 2

#The we print to show the value

print(six)

#Now that you understand the basic concept of assigning values to variables
#Can you solve this problem?

#INSTRUCTION: you have to exchange the "?" with the correct value to make it equal
#Tip: "==" means equal to

y = 8

Test1 = 7 * (y + 3) == 77

print(Test1)

#If result states True, then answer is correct, If False then answer is wrong

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#Now, Moving on to Basic Operations
# "+" is for addition
# "-" is for subtraction
# "*" is for multiplication
# "/" is for division

#other complex operations are:
# "**" is for Exponent
# "//" is for floor division (Automatically Rounds down the result, if decimal is available)
# "%" is for Modulo (Remainder of the division)
# "==" is for equal
# ">" is for greater than
# "< is" for less than
# ">=" is for greater than or equal
# "<=" is for less than or equal

#Now let us practice the operations

#We will use "m" and "n" for the example

m = 5
n = 3

#For Addition "+"

Add = m + n
print(Add)

#For Subtraction "-"

Sub = m - n
print(Sub)

#For Multiplication "*"

Mul = m * n
print(Mul)

#For Division "/"

Div = m / n
print(Div)

#For Exponent "**"
Exp = m ** n
print(Exp)

#For Floor Division "//"
F_Div = m // n
print(F_Div)

#For Modulo "%"
Mod = m % n
print(Mod)

# Above represents how you can use the operations

#QUIZ!!!

#1. Set "6" with  variable "x1", "13" with "y1" and "7" with "z1"
    #Using the variable given, add 6 with 13 then subtract 7; name the operations "num_1"



#2. What is the remainder of 3872 divided by 43, name the operation "num_2"



#3. What is the remainder and quotient for "x3" raise to "y3" divided by "z3"
    #If "x3 = 13", "y3 = 4", "z3 = 23". Name the operation "num_3Q" for the quotient and "num_3R" for the remainder



#4. Find the value of "x4"
x4 = n

num_4 = 3 < x4 < 5
print(num_4)

#5. Divide "x5" with "y5"
    #"x5 = 2/3", "y5 = 4/7". Assign name "num_5"



#6. Input the correct operation between "(4 / 2)" and "8"

num_6 = (4 / 2) + 8 + 23 == 39
print(num_6)

#7. What is the quotient when divided by "z7" of the remainder of "x7" and "y7"
    #If "x7 = 9866", "y7 = 17", "z7 = 2". Assign name as "num_7"



#8. Assign the correct values
    # Given Values to use "4, 30, 83, 17". Only include the integer, without the decimal

x8 = 17
y8 = 4
z8 = 83
w8 = 30

num_8 = (x8 ** y8) / z8 + w8 == 1036
print(num_8)

#9. Fulfill the arithmetic sequence using "x9 as number of times", "y9 as starting value" and "z9 as the difference for each sequence"
    #Given that "x9 = 13" and "y9 = 7"

x9 = 13
y9 = 7
z9 = n

num_9 = ((x9 - 1) * z9) + y9 == 61
print(num_9)

#10. Create your own arithmetic sequence. Find the answer
    #Given that "x10 = 7", "y10 = 6" and "z10 = 14". Name the operation "num_10"
